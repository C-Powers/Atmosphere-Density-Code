# Atmosphere-Density-Code

This was created before I knew that git existed, and code was mostly shared through dropbox. I have since seen the light.

The purpose of this code was to determine how the upper atmosphere density changed with distance from the Earth. 

This was done by taking photos of the sky as as the sun descended, and by analyzing the change in luminosity.
